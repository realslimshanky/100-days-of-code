**Today's Progress**: Looked Into Minor Issues On My Previous Github Repository.

**Thoughts:** On day 1 I wanted to start light so I looked at some issues on my previous repos like Dynamic Calculator. I resolved some issues and pushed code back to github.

### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on GNDG Community Website.

**Thoughts:** Today I studied the wireframe contributed to GNDG repo and tried to made some changes to make it more understandable. For that I created 2 wireframes one for each [DESKTOP](https://www.figma.com/file/PmO4kZ4aQKr9lRldCtQ957/GNDG-(Desktop)) and [MOBILE](https://www.figma.com/file/T5lz8rt0hApI2dqGnhjO3h/GNDG-(Mobile)), I plan to move forward in developing the website based on these wireframes and commit soon on github repo.
