**Thoughts:** Today I studied the wireframe contributed to GNDG repo and tried to made some changes to make it more understandable.

### Day 4: January 6th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created UX Elements on CodePen.

**Thoughts:** I was working on GNDG website when I thought of creating some UX elements (hr etc) which will look more interactive on the website, hence I worked on some HR tags and transformed then in a way that they looked to move in a flow. Will be working some other UX elements for and add them on GNDG website.

### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Contributed to PyDelhi Conference Website

**Thoughts:** PyDelhi conference is scheduled on 18th March 2017, and the community is busy in it's planning and organisation. Also, the website dedicated to the conference needed sum minor changes in Schedule Section so I stepped in and change the whole section. Also worked my way through making it responsive. So, the section is a Table on Desktop (i.e. > 500px) and the Table Header is changed to Tabs (Buttons) to display only one Column at a time on Mobile (i.e. <= 500px).
