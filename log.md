### Day 8: January 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Contributed to PyDelhi Conference Website

**Thoughts:** PyDelhi conference is scheduled on 18th March 2017, and the community is busy in it's planning and organisation. Also, the website dedicated to the conference needed sum minor changes in Schedule Section so I stepped in and change the whole section. Also worked my way through making it responsive. So, the section is a Table on Desktop (i.e. > 500px) and the Table Header is changed to Tabs (Buttons) to display only one Column at a time on Mobile (i.e. <= 500px).

### Day 15: January 20th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Deployed Python Bot for Telegram on AWS

**Thoughts:** I've been looking for this weekend for a long time when I could get some time to explore more of AWS services and deploy python bot. Idea is to make a bot using python-telegram-bot module and allow people to share there notes and news as desperate times.

### Day 16: January 21th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created PyDelhi Bot for Telegram

**Thoughts:** Today,at PyDelhi regular Meetup even I gave a lighting talk on Telegram Bot using python. During this talk I created a bot which can respond to only 1 command. Later I expanded the script and made it work with many more commands. I used the same python-telegram-bot package with some others to make this possible.

### Day 17: January 22th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debugged PyDelhi Bot

**Thoughts:** PyDelhi Bot had a Bug because of which the time for upcoming meetup was displayed in the timezone where the server is deployed i.e. US and not IST. So, I looked into it and with the help of a new module [pytz](http://launchpad.net/pytz) which helped ease the conversion of timezones.

### Day 18: January 23th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Problems on HackerRank

**Thoughts:** Went through some of the problems displayed under Python domain and strings category and solved some of them. It's difficult to optimize a python algorith for given time constraints and I'm planning to strech out and raise some skill level with C++.

### Day 19: January 24th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Modification in schedule section of PyDelhi Conference website

**Thoughts:** The PyDelhi Conference is expanded to 2 days. First day, the 18th March is only comprised of Talks and second day i.e. 19th will be a workshop day. So schedule section on the website needed to be changed and a new segment for second day has to be added. I made this possible be adding buttons for both days and some jquery to change the view of table. Finally added commits to my previous PR.
