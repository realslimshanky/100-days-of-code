# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Looked Into Minor Issues On My Previous Github Repository.

**Thoughts:** On day 1 I wanted to start light so I looked at some issues on my previous repos like Dynamic Calculator. I resolved some issues and pushed code back to github.
